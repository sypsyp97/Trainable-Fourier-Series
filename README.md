PyTorch implementation of our paper ["Data-Driven Filter Design in FBP: Transforming CT Reconstruction with Trainable Fourier Series"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16039) on **8th International Conference on Image Formation in X-Ray Computed Tomography, Bamberg, Germany**.

## Requirements

The code is developed using Python 3.11 and PyTorch 2.0.0. 
Installation guide can be found in [pyronn](pyronn).
